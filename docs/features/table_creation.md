# Table Creation

As of version 3, `cmd2` no longer includes code for table creation.

This is because `cmd2` now has a dependency on [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) which has
excellent support for this feature.

Please see rich's documentation on [Tables](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tables.html) for
more information.
