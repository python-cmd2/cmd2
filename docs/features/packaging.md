# Packaging a cmd2 application for distribution

As a general-purpose tool for building interactive command-line applications, `cmd2` is designed to be used in many ways. How you distribute your `cmd2` application to customers or end users is up to you. See the [Overview of Packaging for Python](https://packaging.python.org/overview/) from the Python Packaging Authority for a thorough discussion of the extensive options within the Python ecosystem.

For developers wishing to package a `cmd2` application into a single binary image or compressed file, we can recommend all of the following based on personal and professional experience:

-   Deploy your `cmd2` Python app using [Docker](https://djangostars.com/blog/what-is-docker-and-how-to-use-it-with-python/)

    * Powerful and flexible - allows you to control entire user space and setup other applications like databases

    * As long as it isn't problematic for your customers to have Docker installed, then this is probably the best option

-   [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org)

    * Quick and easy - it "just works" and everything you need is installable via `pip`

    * Packages up all of the dependencies into a single directory which you can then zip up

-   [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net)

    -   Converts your Python to C and compiles it to a native binary file

    * This can be particularly convenient if you wish to obfuscate the Python source code behind your application

    * Recommend invoking with `--follow-imports` flag like: `python3 -m nuitka --follow-imports your_app.py`
