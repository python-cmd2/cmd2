# Multiline Commands

Command input may span multiple lines for the commands whose names are listed in the `multiline_commands` argument to `cmd2.Cmd.__init__()`. These commands will be executed only after the user has entered a *terminator*. By default, the command terminator is `;`; specifying the `terminators` optional argument to `cmd2.Cmd.__init__()` allows different terminators. A blank line is *always* considered a command terminator (cannot be overridden).

In multiline commands, output redirection characters like `>` and `|` are part of the command arguments unless they appear after the terminator.

## Continuation prompt

When a user types a `Multiline Command
<features/multiline_commands:Multiline Commands>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} it may span more than one line of input. The prompt for the first line of input is specified by the `cmd2.Cmd.prompt`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} instance attribute - see `features/prompt:Customizing the Prompt`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}. The prompt for subsequent lines of input is defined by the `cmd2.Cmd.continuation_prompt`{.interpreted-text role="attr"} attribute.

## Use cases

Multiline commands should probably be used sparingly in order to preserve a good user experience for your `cmd2`-based line-oriented command interpreter application.

However, some use cases benefit significantly from the ability to have commands that span more than one line. For example, you might want the ability for your user to type in a SQL command, which can often span lines and which are terminated with a semicolon.

We estimate that less than 5 percent of `cmd2` applications use this feature. But it is here for those use cases where it provides value.
