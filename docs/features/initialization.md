# Initialization

Here is a basic example `cmd2` application which demonstrates many capabilities which you may wish to utilize while initializing the app:

!!! example "examples/getting_started.py"

    ```py
    {%
        include "../../examples/getting_started.py"
    %}
    ```

## Cmd class initializer

A `cmd2.Cmd` instance or subclass instance is an interactive CLI application framework. There is no good reason to instantiate `Cmd` itself; rather, it's useful as a superclass of a class you define yourself in order to inherit `Cmd`'s methods and encapsulate action methods.

Certain things must be initialized within the `__init__()` method of your class derived from `cmd2.Cmd`(all arguments to `__init__()` are optional):

::: cmd2.Cmd.__init__

## Cmd instance attributes

The `cmd2.Cmd` class provides a large number of public instance attributes which allow developers to customize a `cmd2` application further beyond the options provided by the `__init__()` method.

### Public instance attributes

Here are instance attributes of `cmd2.Cmd` which developers might wish to override:

- **always_show_hint**: if `True`, display tab completion hint even when completion suggestions print (Default: `False`)
- **broken_pipe_warning**: if non-empty, this string will be displayed if a broken pipe error occurs
- **continuation_prompt**: used for multiline commands on 2nd+ line of input
- **debug**: if `True`, show full stack trace on error (Default: `False`)
- **default_category**: if any command has been categorized, then all other commands that haven't been categorized will display under this section in the help output.
- **default_error**: the error that prints when a non-existent command is run
- **default_sort_key**: the default key for sorting string results. Its default value performs a case-insensitive alphabetical sort.
- **default_to_shell**: if `True`, attempt to run unrecognized commands as shell commands (Default: `False`)
- **disabled_commands**: commands that have been disabled from use. This is to support commands that are only available during specific states of the application. This dictionary's keys are the command names and its values are DisabledCommand objects.
- **doc_header**: Set the header used for the help function's listing of documented functions
- **echo**: if `True`, each command the user issues will be repeated to the screen before it is executed. This is particularly useful when running scripts. This behavior does not occur when running a command at the prompt. (Default: `False`)
- **editor**: text editor program to use with _edit_ command (e.g. `vim`)
- **exclude_from_history**: commands to exclude from the _history_ command
- **exit_code**: this determines the value returned by `cmdloop()` when exiting the application
- **feedback_to_output**: if `True`, send nonessential output to stdout, if `False` send them to stderr (Default: `False`)
- **help_error**: the error that prints when no help information can be found
- **hidden_commands**: commands to exclude from the help menu and tab completion
- **last_result**: stores results from the last command run to enable usage of results in a Python script or interactive console. Built-in commands don't make use of this. It is purely there for user-defined commands and convenience.
- **macros**: dictionary of macro names and their values
- **max_completion_items**: max number of CompletionItems to display during tab completion (Default: 50)
- **pager**: sets the pager command used by the `Cmd.ppaged()` method for displaying wrapped output using a pager
- **pager_chop**: sets the pager command used by the `Cmd.ppaged()` method for displaying chopped/truncated output using a pager
- **py_bridge_name**: name by which embedded Python environments and scripts refer to the `cmd2` application by in order to call commands (Default: `app`)
- **py_locals**: dictionary that defines specific variables/functions available in Python shells and scripts (provides more fine-grained control than making everything available with **self_in_py**)
- **quiet**: if `True`, then completely suppress nonessential output (Default: `False`)
- **scripts_add_to_history**: if `True`, scripts and pyscripts add commands to history (Default: `True`)
- **self_in_py**: if `True`, allow access to your application in _py_ command via `self` (Default: `False`)
- **settable**: dictionary that controls which of these instance attributes are settable at runtime using the _set_ command
- **timing**: if `True`, display execution time for each command (Default: `False`)
