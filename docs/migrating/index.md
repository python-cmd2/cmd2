# Migrating From cmd

If you're thinking of migrating your [cmd](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html) app to
`cmd2`, this section will help you decide if it's right for your app, and show you how to do it.

- [Why cmd2](why.md) - we try and convince you to use `cmd2` instead of
  [cmd](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html)
- [Incompatibilities](incompatibilities.md) - `cmd2` is not quite 100% compatible with
  [cmd](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html).
- [Minimum Required Changes](minimum.md) - the minimum changes required to move from
  [cmd](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html) to `cmd2`. Start your migration here.
- [Next Steps](next_steps.md) - Once you've migrated, here is a list of things you can do next to
  add even more functionality to your app.
