# API Reference

These pages document the public API for `cmd2`. If a method, class, function, attribute, or constant
is not documented here, consider it private and subject to change. There are many classes, methods,
functions, and constants in the source code which do not begin with an underscore but are not
documented here. When looking at the source code for this library, you cannot safely assume that
because something doesn't start with an underscore, it is a public API.

If a release of this library changes any of the items documented here, the version number will be
incremented according to the [Semantic Version Specification](https://semver.org).
