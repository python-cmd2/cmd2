Classes for parsing and storing user input.

.. autoclass:: cmd2.Statement
    :members:

    .. attribute:: command

      The name of the command after shortcuts have been expanded

    .. attribute:: args

      The arguments to the command as a string with spaces between the words,
      excluding output redirection and command terminators. If the user used
      quotes in their input, they remain here, and you will have to handle them
      on your own.

    .. attribute:: arg_list

      The arguments to the command as a list, excluding output
      redirection and command terminators. Each argument is represented as an
      element in the list. Quoted arguments remain quoted. If you want to
      remove the quotes, use :func:`cmd2.utils.strip_quotes` or use
      ``argv[1:]``

    .. attribute:: raw

      If you want full access to exactly what the user typed at the input
      prompt you can get it, but you'll have to parse it on your own,
      including:

        - shortcuts and aliases
        - quoted commands and arguments
        - output redirection
        - multi-line command terminator handling

      If you use multiline commands, all the input will be passed to you in
      this string, but there will be embedded newlines where the user hit
      return to continue the command on the next line.

    .. attribute:: multiline_command

      If the command is a multi-line command, the name of the command will be
      in this attribute. Otherwise, it will be an empty string.

    .. attribute:: terminator

      If the command is a multi-line command, this attribute contains the
      termination character entered by the user to signal the end of input

    .. attribute:: suffix

      Any characters present between the input terminator and the output
      redirection tokens.

    .. attribute:: pipe_to

      If the user piped the output to a shell command, this attribute contains
      the entire shell command as a string. Otherwise it is an empty string.

    .. attribute:: output

      If output was redirected by the user, this contains the redirection
      token, i.e. ``>>``.

    .. attribute:: output_to

      If output was redirected by the user, this contains the requested destination with
      quotes preserved.
