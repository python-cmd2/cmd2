"""A simple example demonstrating how to remove unused commands.

Commands can be removed from  help menu and tab completion by appending their command name to the hidden_commands list.
These commands will still exist and can be executed and help can be retrieved for them by
name, they just won't clutter the help menu.

Commands can also be removed entirely by using Python's "del".
