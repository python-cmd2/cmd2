"""A sample application for how Python scripting can provide conditional
control flow of a cmd2 application.

cmd2's built-in scripting capability, which can be invoked via the "@" shortcut
or "run_script" command, uses basic ASCII/UTF-8 text scripts and is very easy
to use.  Moreover, the trivial syntax of the script files, where there is one
command per line and the line is exactly what the user would type inside the
application, makes it so non-technical that end users can quickly learn to
create scripts.

However, there comes a time when technical end users want more capability and
power.  In particular it is common that users will want to create a script with
conditional control flow - where the next command run will depend on the
results from the previous command.  This is where the ability to run Python
scripts inside a cmd2 application via the run_pyscript command and the
"run_pyscript <script> [arguments]" syntax comes into play.

This application and the "examples/scripts/conditional.py" script serve as an
example for one way in which this can be done.
