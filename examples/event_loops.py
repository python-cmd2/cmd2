"""A sample application for integrating cmd2 with external event loops.

This is an example of how to use cmd2 in a way so that cmd2 doesn't own the inner event loop of your application.

This opens up the possibility of registering cmd2 input with event loops, like asyncio, without occupying the main loop.
