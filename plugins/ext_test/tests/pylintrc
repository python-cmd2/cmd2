# too-many-public-methods -> test classes can have lots of methods, so let's ignore those
# missing-docstring -> prefer method names instead of docstrings
# no-self-use -> test methods part of a class hardly ever use self
# unused-variable -> sometimes we are expecting exceptions
# redefined-outer-name -> pylint fixtures cause these
# protected-access -> we want to test private methods
