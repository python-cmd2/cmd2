    """String subclass with additional attributes to store the results of parsing.

    The cmd module in the standard library passes commands around as a
    string. To retain backwards compatibility, cmd2 does the same. However, we
    need a place to capture the additional output of the command parsing, so we add
    our own attributes to this subclass.

    The string portion of the class contains the arguments, but not the command, nor
    the output redirection clauses.

    :var raw:               string containing exactly what we input by the user
    :type raw:              str
    :var command:           the command, i.e. the first whitespace delimited word
    :type command:          str or None
    :var multiline_command: if the command is a multiline command, the name of the
                            command, otherwise None
    :type command:          str or None
    :var args:              the arguments to the command, not including any output
                            redirection or terminators. quoted arguments remain
                            quoted.
    :type args:             str or None
    :var: argv:             a list of arguments a la sys.argv. Quotes, if any, are removed
                            from the elements of the list, and aliases and shortcuts
                            are expanded
    :type argv:             list
    :var terminator:        the character which terminated the multiline command, if
                            there was one
    :type terminator:       str or None
    :var suffix:            characters appearing after the terminator but before output
                            redirection, if any
    :type suffix:           str or None
    :var pipe_to:           if output was piped to a shell command, the shell command
                            as a list of tokens
    :type pipe_to:          list
    :var output:            if output was redirected, the redirection token, i.e. '>>'

    :var output_to:         if output was redirected, the destination file
